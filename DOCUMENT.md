```typescript
export interface Expert {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  specialization: string;
  experience: number;
  rating: number;
  photoURL: string;
  availability: {
    day: string;
    slots: string[];
  }[];
}
```

```typescript
export interface Appointment {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  expertId: string;
  expertName?: string;
  expertSpecialization?: string;
  date: string;
  time: string;
  status: 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  meetingLink?: string;
  notes?: string;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

## Critical Components Remaining

### AI Integration
The core AI functionality is not yet implemented, including:
- Integration with an LLM for text consultations
- Speech-to-Text (STT) processing using Deepgram Nova-3
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) using ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5
- Real-time voice processing pipeline

### Payment System
The payment integration is incomplete:
- Razorpay integration for handling transactions
- Subscription model implementation
- Pay-per-call pricing options
- Secure payment processing
- Invoice generation

### Multilingual Support
The multilingual capabilities are not implemented:
- UI language switching
- Content translation
- Voice processing in multiple languages

### Calendar Integration
The scheduling system needs to be connected to calendar services:
- Google Calendar API integration
- Calendar event creation and management
- Notification system for appointments

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1: Core AI Functionality**
   - Implement the LLM integration for text-based consultations
   - Set up the voice processing pipeline with STT and TTS
   - Create the chat interface for AI interactions

2. **Priority 2: Payment System**
   - Integrate Razorpay for payment processing
   - Implement subscription and pay-per-call options
   - Create secure payment flows and invoice generation

3. **Priority 3: Expert Consultation Enhancement**
   - Complete the expert management system
   - Implement the expert dashboard
   - Add rating and review functionality

4. **Priority 4: Multilingual Support**
   - Implement language switching in the UI
   - Set up multilingual voice processing
   - Test with various languages to ensure compatibility

## Technical Debt and Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - The current implementation may need optimization for handling real-time voice processing
   - Database queries should be optimized for scalability

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Payment security measures need implementation
   - Data encryption for sensitive user information
   - HIPAA compliance for medical consultations

3. **API Integration Requirements**
   - API keys needed for Razorpay, LLM, STT, and TTS services
   - Integration testing with each third-party service
