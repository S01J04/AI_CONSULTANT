# Payment System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Testing Mode Configuration Inconsistency**
**Problem**: The testing mode was set to 30 minutes but UI showed 2 minutes.
**Fix**: Updated `TEST_EXPIRY_MINUTES` from 30 to 2 minutes in `src/utils/planAccess.ts` to match UI display.

### 2. **Aggressive Subscription Auto-Reset**
**Problem**: The subscription service was immediately checking and resetting subscriptions on app load, causing newly purchased subscriptions to be reset.
**Fix**: Added protection mechanisms:
- **Grace Period in Expiry Check**: Added 5-minute grace period in `isSubscriptionExpired()` function
- **Recent Purchase Protection**: Added 10-minute protection in `checkAndResetExpiredSubscription()` to skip expiry checks for recently purchased subscriptions

### 3. **Timer Component Page Reload**
**Problem**: The subscription timer component was automatically reloading the page when expiry was detected, causing disruption after payment.
**Fix**: Removed automatic page reload from `SubscriptionStatusCard.tsx` and let the subscription service handle resets gracefully.

### 4. **Payment Success Flow Race Condition**
**Problem**: The payment success flow had potential race conditions between Redux state updates and Firestore updates.
**Fix**: Restructured the payment success flow in `PaymentSuccess.tsx`:
- Update user plan in Firestore first (source of truth)
- Then create payment record in Redux
- Better error handling and TypeScript typing

### 5. **Critical Race Condition During Payment Processing** ⭐ **NEW FIX**
**Problem**: Multiple instances of the subscription service were running simultaneously during payment processing, all checking stale user data and resetting the plan before the update completed.
**Fix**: Implemented payment processing locks in `subscriptionService.ts`:
- **Payment Processing Lock**: Users are marked as "processing payment" to completely disable subscription checks
- **Automatic Unlock**: Lock is automatically removed after 2 minutes as a safety measure
- **Manual Unlock**: Lock is removed when payment processing completes (success or failure)
- **Double-Check with Latest Data**: Subscription service now fetches latest user data before making reset decisions

### 6. **Timer-Triggered Subscription Reset** ⭐ **NEW FIX**
**Problem**: When the timer reached zero, the subscription wasn't being reset automatically due to protection mechanisms.
**Fix**: Added active timer-triggered reset functionality:
- **Timer Detection**: Timer component actively detects when subscription expires
- **Force Reset**: Timer can bypass protection mechanisms to force subscription reset
- **UI Refresh**: Automatically refreshes user data when timer triggers reset
- **Single Trigger**: Prevents multiple reset attempts with trigger flag

### 7. **Improved Logging and Debugging**
**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the system:
- Protection status logging in `updateUserPlan`
- Grace period logging in subscription service
- Better error tracking in payment flow
- Payment processing lock status logging
- Timer-triggered reset logging

## Files Modified

- Enhanced expiry checking logic

### `src/services/subscriptionService.ts`

- Improved logging for debugging subscription resets

### `src/components/dashboard/SubscriptionStatusCard.tsx`
- Removed automatic page reload on expiry
- Let subscription service handle resets gracefully

### `src/components/payment/PaymentSuccess.tsx`
- Fixed TypeScript typing issues
- Restructured payment flow for better reliability
- Improved error handling

### `src/redux/slices/authSlice.ts`
- Added protection status logging
- Enhanced debugging information

## How the Fixes Work

### Protection Mechanisms
1. **Payment Processing Lock**: Users are completely locked from subscription checks during payment processing
2. **5-minute grace period**: Newly purchased subscriptions are protected from expiry checks for 5 minutes
3. **10-minute recent purchase protection**: Subscription service skips expiry checks for subscriptions purchased within 10 minutes
4. **No automatic page reload**: Timer component no longer forces page reloads
5. **Double-check with latest data**: Subscription service fetches fresh user data before making reset decisions

### Payment Flow
1. User completes Stripe payment
2. PaymentSuccess component **locks the user** to prevent subscription service interference
3. Updates user plan in Firestore first (source of truth)
4. Creates payment record in Redux
5. **Unlocks the user** when processing is complete
6. Subscription is protected from auto-reset for 10 minutes
7. Timer starts correctly and shows proper countdown

### Debugging
- Comprehensive logging shows when protections are active
- Clear indication of subscription status changes
- Better error tracking for troubleshooting

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Successful Payment**: Timer should start immediately and count down properly
2. **No Immediate Reset**: Subscriptions won't be reset immediately after purchase
3. **Proper Countdown**: Timer counts down from 2 minutes to 00:00
4. **Automatic Reset**: When timer reaches 00:00, subscription is automatically reset
5. **UI Update**: User interface immediately updates to show "No Active Plan" status
6. **Graceful Handling**: No unexpected page reloads or subscription resets during payment
7. **Better Debugging**: Clear logs show what's happening with subscriptions and timer triggers

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Payment Flow**: Complete a payment and verify timer starts correctly
2. **Test Grace Period**: Verify subscriptions aren't reset immediately after purchase
3. **Test Expiry**: Verify subscriptions expire correctly after 2 minutes in testing mode
4. **Test App Reload**: Verify app reload doesn't reset active subscriptions
5. **Check Logs**: Monitor console logs for protection status and debugging info

## Notes

- Testing mode is still enabled (`TESTING_MODE = true`)
- Subscriptions expire after 2 minutes in testing mode
- All protections are automatically applied
- No manual intervention needed for the fixes to work
